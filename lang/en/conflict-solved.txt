====== A newer version was merged ======

A newer version of the document you edited exists. This happens when another
user changed the document while you were editing it.

However, the changes made don't affect those made by you, so both versions
could be merged automatically.

Below are shown the differences between the latest revision of the document and
the merged version. Examine them, then decide if you want to save the merged
version right now, edit it to make further changes, or cancel the edition.
