====== A newer version exists ======

A newer version of the document you edited exists. This happens when another
user changed the document while you were editing it.

The changes made conflict with those made by you, so both versions couldn't be
merged automatically.

Below are shown the differences between the latest revision of the document and
the one you are working on. Examine them, then decide if you want to save your
version right now overwriting the latest revision, edit your version to adapt
to the new contents, or cancel the edition.

Note that if you edit your version but you don't fix the conflicts with the
latest revision you'll get again this warning page when saving the edition.

If the conflicts are fixed, you'll get another page informing you about it.
