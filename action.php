/**
 * Action plugin for Dokuwiki to automatically merge changes with latest
 * revision when saving a document.
 *
 * This plugin intercepts 'edit' and 'save' actions and redirects them to a
 * custom action, 'conflictSolving', when needed. That happens when some changes
 * were made to the document while it was being edited (being it a pure edition,
 * or a conflict solving page).
 *
 * When a 'conflictSolving' action is received, a conflict solving page is
 * shown. If the conflict could be solved, the text being edited and the latest
 * version of the document are merged. Otherwise, no merging happens (when the
 * changes conflict, or when the solving failed). The page also shows the
 * differences between versions, and buttons to save the text, make further
 * editions or cancel the edition.
 *
 * The edit form is bypassed to use the text already being worked on (for
 * example, editting a conflict not mergeable), instead of the latest version of
 * the page.
 *
 * It uses diff3 command. The path to it can be configured through the
 * configuration plugin.

     * Fires "conflictSolving" events when needed.
     * A conflict appears in edit and save actions when the page was modified
     * after the edit or conflict forms were shown. That is, even if the page is
     * modified again while the user is looking to a conflict form, a new
     * conflict form will appear informing the user about it.
     *
     * Also, note the following scenario: user A starts editing a page, user B
     * edits and saves the page, and user A saves the page. A conflict form will
     * be shown to user A, as the page was changed while it was being edited.
     * Now, the user A decides to further edit the page.
     *
     * If the merge was successfull, when the user hit save button in the edit
     * form, the text will be directly saved (provided no other user changes the
     * page in the meantime). That is, now the revision to check conflicts
     * against is the revision the text was merged with, instead of the revision
     * of the page when the fresh edition was started.
     *
     * However, it is different in the case of an unsuccessful merge. In that
     * case, as the contents weren't merged, the revision to check conflicts
     * against is the revision of the page when the fresh edition was started.
     * So even if the text is edited to avoid conflicts, a conflict form will
     * appear, although a successful one. Once a successful merge form appears,
     * the revision to check conflicts against is updated to the latest revision
     * of the page.
